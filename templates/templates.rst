Subscribie comes with an excellent default template called `Jesmond`_. Every 
template gets passed a `Jamla` object, which gives you access to all information 
in your :ref:`jamla<jamla-latest>` file.

.. warning::
  Never output sensitive information from your Jamla file to your
  visitors.

Jesmond
**********
**"jesmond"** is the name of the default template for subscription website
builder. Jesmond is a sane default to get you up and selling quickly. Note the 
emphasis on selling. Don't waste time reinventing patterns. This theme is fast a
fast progessive web app
`(PWA) <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive>`_ which means you 
get all the benefits of fast modern experiences usually only found on larger
sites

By default you have the `jesmond` template installed, but of course you can 
create your own by editing your jamla :ref:`jamla-template` setting to point to
another template.

Editing the template
***********************
It is not recommended to edit the template directly because your changes would
be overwitten when you update to the latest Jesmond template. Instead you would 
create your own template.

Changing the template
***********************

To change to a different template, update the name of the 
:ref:`template<jamla-template>` in your Jamla file.
